VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Lingua::ID::Number::Format::MixWithWords qw(format_number_mix);

     print format_number_mix(num => 1.23e7); # prints "12,3 juta"

DESCRIPTION
    This module formats number with Indonesian names of large numbers (ribu,
    juta, miliar, triliun, and so on), e.g. 1.23e7 becomes "12,3 juta". If
    number is too small or too large so it does not have any appropriate
    names, it will be formatted like a normal number.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  format_number_mix(%args) -> RESULT
    Arguments ("*" denotes required arguments):

    *   min_format* => *float* (default 1000000)

        Number must be larger than this to be formatted as mixture of number
        and word.

    *   min_fraction* => *float* (default 1)

        Whether smaller number can be formatted with 0,x.

        If min_fraction is 1 (the default) or 0.9, 800000 won't be formatted
        as 0.9 omillion but will be if min_fraction is 0.8.

    *   num* => *float*

        The input number to format.

    *   num_decimal => *int*

        Number of decimal points to round.

        Can be negative, e.g. -1 to round to nearest 10, -2 to nearest 100,
        and so on.
