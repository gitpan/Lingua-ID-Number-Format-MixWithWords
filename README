     print format_number_mix(num => 1.23e7); # prints "12,3 juta"

DESCRIPTION
    This module formats number with Indonesian names of large numbers (ribu,
    juta, miliar, triliun, and so on), e.g. 1.23e7 becomes "12,3 juta". If
    number is too small or too large so it does not have any appropriate
    names, it will be formatted like a normal number.

FUNCTIONS
  format_number_mix(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   min_format* => *float* (default: 1000000)

        Number must be larger than this to be formatted as mixture of number
        and word.

    *   min_fraction* => *float* (default: 1)

        Whether smaller number can be formatted with 0,x.

        If minfraction is 1 (the default) or 0.9, 800000 won't be formatted
        as 0.9 omillion but will be if minfraction is 0.8.

    *   num* => *float*

        The input number to format.

    *   num_decimal => *int*

        Number of decimal points to round.

        Can be negative, e.g. -1 to round to nearest 10, -2 to nearest 100,
        and so on.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
